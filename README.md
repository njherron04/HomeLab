# 🏡 HomeLab  

A personal repository for experimenting with **networking** and **security fundamentals**.  
This repo is part of my ongoing journey to grow as an engineer and security professional, showing my hobbyist interest in cybersecurity and system design.  

---

## 🔐 Focus Areas
- Networking basics – sockets, ports, client/server models  
- Security fundamentals – authentication, encryption, monitoring  
- Programming practice – primarily Python and C#

## 📂 Projects

### 🔹 TCP Chat Server (Python)
A simple client–server chat system for learning **socket programming** and **multi-threaded communication**.  
- **Server** – accepts a client connection and relays messages.  
- **Client** – connects to the server and enables real-time two-way messaging.  
- **Tech** – Python `socket` + `threading`
